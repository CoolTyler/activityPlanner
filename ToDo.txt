1.  Why doesn't my guest count reflect the number of rsvps for each activity in my tablePartial?
2.  Why does my JOIN link throw an error when going back to "Success"? Do I need to update allActivities and pass them back?
3.  Make it so you can only JOIN an activity if you've not joined already.
4.  fix the welcome message on the header, the name disappears on some views.
5.  Get the event coordinator name to appear.
